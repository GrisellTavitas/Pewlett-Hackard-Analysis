# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Module 7
**Overview of the analysis**

Pewlett Hackard is a large company of thousands of employees, but nowadays the company has to look forward to the future in human resources speaking, since many of its employees beginin to retire in a short time.

So then, the company has to be prepared in two ways:
  - Offering retirement packages to certain people who accomplish determined criteria. 
  - Which possitions need to be filled in the near future?

According to that, the company needs to receive this next information, in order to take the neccesary decisions:
  - The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
  - The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
 
**Results**: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

As a result of the first query we made, we could see that the total numer of "retirement titles" were 133,776.

Nevertheless some people may have more than one title in the table, due to promotions; based on that, we removed the duplicate titles for each employee. As a result we found 90,398 unique values:

In order to make a plan on each department, for the transition of each position, we will need to know how many people of each position are in the list of retirements:

After having the complete numbers of people for each department, who is ready to access to the retirement package; the company wants to start a mentoring program to make the transition as smooth as posible for the production. 

So the number of people who are eligible for this mentorship program is 1,549; according to the last query we made.

**Summary**: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
